# Digital-clock-using-8051-microcontroller-and-DS1307
The Digital Clock using the 8051 microcontroller and DS1307 real-time clock is a project that combines embedded systems and real-time clock technology. This project involves interfacing an 8051 microcontroller with the DS1307 RTC module to accurately display and maintain the current time on a 16x2 LCD display. The microcontroller is programmed to communicate with the RTC module using the I2C protocol, fetch the time information, and then format and display it on the LCD. Additionally, the project typically includes functionality for setting the time using the code, providing a hands-on learning experience in microcontroller programming and hardware interfacing.
